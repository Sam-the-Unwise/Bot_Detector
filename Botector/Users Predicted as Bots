Question (all), do you want us to double count a point when comparing it to itself?






Serya05 - bootstrap_twbs - this person makes 4 comments, all of them "+1 Approve", so that explains why she gets a "1" rating as a bot. 

willmendesneto - angular.js-angular - he has made 10 comments, but there are only 4 different variations of comments so he recieved an '80'

lvl0nax - rails_rails - made 5 comments referencing people in the form "r? @X"

zev - rails_rails - made 4 comments, but only of two different formats

drcapulet - rails_rails - made 5 comments, four were of two different formats with a different 5th one

lenovouser - linux_torvals - same as dracapulet

parrotgeek1 - linux_torvals - make 5 comments, 4 were the same with 1 different

tedlz123 - tensorflow_tensorflow - made 4 comments that are the same

benoitsteiner - tensorflow_tensorflow - made over 50 comments that are exactly the same (there are others that are not the same, but they are a small number in comparison)

maciekcc - tensorflow_tensorflow - same as benoitsteiner

andydavis1 - tensorflow_tensorflow - same as benoitsteiner

simpeng - tensorflow_tensorflow - 8 comments total, 5 are the exact same, 2 are slightly similar, 1 is different

nestle1993 - tensorflow_tensorflow - 4 comments total, 3 are the exact same

brunomorishita - tensorflow_tensorflow - 6 comments total, 4 are the exact same, two are different
 
frankchn - tensorflow_tensorflow - same as benoitsteiner

rohan100jain - tensorflow_tensorflow - same as benoitsteiner

shlens - tensorflow_tensorflow - 6 comments that are the same, variety of other but most of them resemble each other

FancyCoder0 - tensorflow_tensorflow - comments are slightly different but overwhelmingly similar (there are 6)

pglushkov - tensorflow_tensorflow - same as zev





a lot of people who are mistake for bots make massive amounts of comments that are either ''user' please test', '@user please test', ''user' please test and merge', '@user please test and merge', or 'I've signed the CLA'
